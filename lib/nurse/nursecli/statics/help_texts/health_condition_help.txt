Health condition
-------------------

Description:
    Condition that determines the health of a service based 
    on a set of probes.

Valid values: 
    A health_condition string. health_condition strings are made of
    health_condition parts (see below) separated by spaces.

health_condition parts:
    health_condition => health_aggregation | health_leaf
        - Specifies a health_condition

    health_aggregation =>
        "not" health_condition
            - Negation of a health condition
            
        "and" "(" health_condition "," health_condition ")"
        "or" "(" health_condition "," health_condition ")"
            - And and or aggreagation of health condition

    health_leaf =>
        "success" pos_integer_match
            - A condition on the number of successful probes

        "fails" pos_integer_match
            - A condition on the number of failed probes

    pos_integer_match =>
        "equals" pos_integer
        "gt" pos_integer
        "gte" pos_integer
        "lt" pos_integer
        "lte" pos_integer
        "range" pos_integer pos_integer

    pos_integer =>
        A number greater than 0.

Examples
    - success equals 3
        The number of successful probes need to be = 3
    - not fails range 2 4
        The number of failed probes cannot be between 2 and 4
    - and ( not fails gte 1 , success gte 3)
        The number of failed probes cannot be greater than or equal to 1 and 
        the number of successful probes needs to be greater than or equal to
        3.
